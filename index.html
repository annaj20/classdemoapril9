<p> For my final project, I would like to use the visualisation technique of heat mapping combined with the detective novel Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie. This novel was originally published in 1934 and is one of the most famous detective novels in history. I have not read the novel yet, but when I looked at the chapter pages of the book I found it very interesting that it is divided into three different sections; the first one being a description of the facts that happened on the Orient Express, the second one being a description of the evidence found, and the third being an analysis and verdict made by Hercule Poirot, the also famous detective that appears in several novels by Agatha Christie. The fact that it is divided into these three different sections could for example mean that the language used in every one of these sections is different from each other, and this is what I would like to hopefully find out by doing this project.</p>
<p> Of all the visualisation techniques that we have learned in this minor, I found the heat mapping an interesting one, because it is very approachable as to how one reads the visualisation, which is different from the previous project I did for Hacking the Humanities; I found it quite difficult to read the dendrogram plots I made. Hopefully, because of this approachability, I will be able to make interesting conclusions about the text. However, the one thing I do not know yet, is what I would like to base this heat mapping on. I could for example just base it on sentence length, but it is also possible to look at unique words or even the most common words to try to make a conclusion about if and how the different sections use language differently.</p>
